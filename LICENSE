### How to Use

1. **Copy and Paste:**
   - Replace the existing content in your `README.md` file with the above structure.
   
2. **Update Details:**
   - Customize the placeholders (`your-azure-client-id`, `your-azure-client-secret`, etc.) with your actual configuration details.

3. **Organize Sections:**
   - Ensure each section (Prerequisites, Installation, etc.) is clearly delineated with appropriate Markdown headers (`##`).

4. **Testing Instructions:**
   - In the "Testing the API" section, provide detailed instructions and examples on how to interact with your API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.

By following these steps, you'll have a comprehensive `README.md` file that provides clear instructions on setting up, running, and testing your project, making it easier for others to understand and use your application. Adjust the sections and content as per your project's specific requirements and functionality.
